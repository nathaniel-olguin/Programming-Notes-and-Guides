# Programming Notes & Guides
This repository is for sharing my notes that I have created in a spreadsheet. These notes help me quickly learn and memorize the syntax/semantics of programming languages. I would love to share these notes free to the public so if anyone learns the same way I do these notes can potentially help them!
